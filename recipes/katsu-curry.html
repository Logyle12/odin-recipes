    <h3>Ingredients Needed (Servings 4)</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>&frac12; a packet of 230 grams of House Vermont Curry (medium hot)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>800ml of Water</li>
        <li>400 grams of white or yellow onion - sliced into 1cm wide pieces</li>
        <li>100 grams of carrots - sliced to 7mm / &frac14; inch thick pieces</li>
        <li>250 grams russet or yukon gold potato -  cut to 1.5cm / &frac58; inch cubes</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For The Chicken Katsu:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Chicken Cutlets cut into 2.5cm / 1” wide strips </li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1&frac13; cups Panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For Serving:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups of steamed short grain Japanese rice</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons of fukujinzuke (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <h4>For The Curry Sauce:</h4>
    <ol style="width: 1000px;">
        <li>Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Sauté onion until translucent and edges slightly charred.</li>
        <li>Stir in potatoes and carrots, cooking until they begin to soften.</li>
        <li>Add water, bring to a boil, then reduce to medium-low. Simmer for 7 minutes until vegetables are nearly tender.</li>
        <li>Break curry roux into blocks, add to the pot, and stir gently to blend.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Check sauce consistency—it should resemble béchamel. Adjust with water if too thick, or cook uncovered if too thin.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>For The Chicken:</h4>
    <ol style="width: 1000px;">
        <li>Slice the chicken: Cut the chicken cutlets into 2.5 cm (1 inch) wide strips. Season both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Prepare for coating: In separate shallow dishes, place the flour, beaten egg, and Panko breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Coat the chicken:
            <ul>
                <li>Dip each chicken strip into the flour, coating evenly, and shake off any excess.</li>
                <li>Next, dip the floured chicken into the beaten egg, ensuring it's fully covered.</li>
                <li>Finally, press the egg-coated chicken into the Panko breadcrumbs, making sure the breadcrumbs adhere well on all sides.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Heat the oil: Preheat your oven to 200°C (390°F). Meanwhile, heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers.</li>
        <li>Fry the chicken: Fry the breaded chicken strips in the hot oil, cooking for about 3-4 minutes on each side, until they are golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Bake the chicken: Transfer the fried chicken strips to a baking tray. Bake in the preheated oven for 5-10 minutes to ensure they are fully cooked through and crispy.</li>
        <li>Serve: Remove from the oven and let them rest briefly before serving with the curry.</li>
    </ol>
