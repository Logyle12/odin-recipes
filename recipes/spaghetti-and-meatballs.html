    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol style="width: 1000px;">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 175°C (350°F) and set an oven rack in the middle position.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together 1 large egg, 3 tablespoons each of chopped basil and parsley, 1 teaspoon dried oregano, ¾ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon black pepper, 2 minced garlic cloves, and 60 ml water.</li>
        <li>Add 680 g ground beef, ¾ cup dried Italian breadcrumbs, and ½ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Mix gently until just combined; avoid overworking.</li>
        <li>Form the mixture into golf ball-sized meatballs and place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes. Turn meatballs with a metal spatula and bake for another 10 minutes until browned and nearly cooked through.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, simmer 904 g marinara sauce in a large skillet. Adjust seasoning if needed, adding a pinch of sugar and freshly ground black pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Transfer the browned meatballs to the marinara sauce, discarding excess fat. Cover loosely and simmer for 10 minutes until meatballs are cooked through and flavors meld.</li>
        <li>Cook 453 g spaghetti in well-salted boiling water until al dente. Drain and toss with the sauce and meatballs, ideally in the pasta pot for ease.</li>
        <li>Serve topped with fresh basil and additional grated cheese.</li>
