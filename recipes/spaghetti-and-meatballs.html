                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol style="width: 1000px;" class="instruction-list">
                    <li><strong>Preheat the oven to 175°C (350°F)</strong> and set an oven rack in the <strong>middle position</strong>.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, <strong>whisk together 1 large egg, 3 tablespoons each of chopped basil and parsley, 1 teaspoon dried oregano, ¾ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon black pepper, 2 minced garlic cloves, and 60 ml of water</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Add 680 g ground beef, ¾ cup dried Italian breadcrumbs, and <strong>½ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</strong>. Mix gently until just combined; <strong>avoid overworking</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Form the mixture into <strong>golf ball-sized meatballs</strong> and place on an <strong>ungreased baking sheet</strong>. <strong>Bake for 10 minutes</strong>. Turn meatballs with a metal spatula and bake for another 10 minutes <strong>until browned and nearly cooked through</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, <strong>simmer 904 grams of marinara sauce</strong> in a large skillet. Adjust seasoning if needed, adding a pinch of sugar and freshly ground black pepper to taste.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the browned meatballs to the marinara sauce, <strong>discarding excess fat</strong>. Cover loosely and <strong>simmer for 10 minutes</strong> until meatballs are cooked through and flavors meld.</li>
                    <li>Cook 453 grams of spaghetti <strong>in well-salted boiling water until al dente</strong>. Drain and toss with the sauce and meatballs, ideally in the pasta pot for ease.</li>
